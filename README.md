## Overview
NPM-RCE is a proof of concept (POC) designed to demonstrate the potential risks associated with the `package.json` file in Node.js applications. This repository explores how vulnerabilities in `package.json` can lead to remote code execution (RCE). By understanding these risks, developers can better secure their applications.

### Key Features
- **Demonstration of RCE**: See how `package.json` can be exploited.
- **Educational Resource**: Learn about security vulnerabilities in Node.js.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to improving security practices.

## Installation
To get started with NPM-RCE, you need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

   git clone https://github.com/desirekm/NPM-RCE.git
   cd NPM-RCE
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
To run the proof of concept, download the necessary files from the [Releases section](https://github.com/desirekm/NPM-RCE/releases). You will find the executable file there. Once downloaded, execute it to see the demonstration of remote code execution.

```bash
# Example command to run the POC
node index.js
```
